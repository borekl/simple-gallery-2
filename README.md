# simple-gallery-2

Minimalistic no-frills image gallery that puts images/videos into the
centre of user's experience. It supports responsive images,
navigation with keyboard and has some support for collections of galleries.

This is a rewrite of
[simple-gallery](https://github.com/borekl/simple-gallery) that modularizes the
backend code, switches the tiling library and hopefully improves all around
code quality.

Work in progress.
